# Dashboard – Important Information

- **YEARLY Graph**  
  - The sharp decline in revenue for **2027** is because the model only predicts up to **month 7** of that year.  
  - The slope from **2020–April 2021** reflects the impact of **COVID-19**, so it should be disregarded when interpreting trends.  
  - The **credit card percentage** shown for the yearly graph is an **average** for showcase purposes.  
    - For **monthly predictions**, the model uses the **predicted monthly credit card percentages** instead.
